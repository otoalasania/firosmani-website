            <p> Niko Pirosmani (Georgian: ნიკო ფიროსმანი), simply referred to as Nikala (ნიკალა) (1862–1918), was a
                Georgian naïve painter who posthumously rose to prominence. Relatively poor for most of his life, he
                worked a variety of ordinary jobs. His rustic, everyday scenes are celebrated today for their depiction
                of the Georgia of Pirosmani's lifetime, and he has become one of the country's most beloved artistic
                figures. <br>Niko Pirosmani is alleged to be the inspiration for the male protagonist potrayed in the
                famous Russian song Million Roses.
                Pirosmani was born in the Georgian village of Mirzaani to a peasant family in modern-day Kakheti
                province. His parents, Aslan Pirosmanashvili and Tekle Toklikishvili, were farmers, who owned a small
                vineyard, with a few cows and oxen. He was later orphaned and left in the care of his two elder sisters,
                Mariam and Pepe. He moved with them to Tbilisi in 1870. In 1872, while living in a little apartment not
                far from Tbilisi railway station, he worked as a servant to wealthy families and learned to read and
                write Russian and Georgian. In 1876, he returned to Mirzaani and worked as a herdsman.
                Pirosmani gradually taught himself to paint. One of his specialties was painting directly into black
                oilcloth. In 1882, with self-taught George Zaziashvili, he opened a painting workshop, where they made
                signboards. In 1890, he worked as a railroad conductor. In 1893, he co-founded a dairy farm in Tbilisi,
                which he left in 1901. Throughout his life, Pirosmani, who was poor, was willing to take ordinary jobs
                including housepainting and whitewashing buildings.

                He also worked for shopkeepers in Tbilisi, creating
                signboards, paintings, and portraits, according to their orders. Although his paintings had some local
                popularity (about 200 survive) his relationship with professional artists remained uneasy; making a
                living was always more important to him than aesthetic abstractions.
                In April 1918, he died in the 1918 flu pandemic as a result of malnutrition and liver failure. He was
                buried at the Nino cemetery; the exact location was not registered and is unknown.In 1876, he returned
